# Welcome!
This GitHub organization contains all the official packages for the Bee package manager, also known as BeePM/BPM! 
You can download the package manager from our repository, [here](https://github.com/BeePackages/Bee). 
The Bee project brings another copyleft and open-source package manager to GNU/Linux. This package 
manager aims to compliment other existing package managers such as `apt`, `dnf`, `portage`, etc. 
Dependencies are often times installed from your GNU/Linux distribution's repositories. 

> **Note**: As the development of the BeePM project continues, more and more distribution packages will be replaced.

# Is Bee for Me?

No, the BeePM project is nowhere near finished or usable! Very intrusive changes are constantly being made in 
order to make it as user-friendly as possible. BeePM does not have proper packages yet, as you may have noticed.
Without a large arsenal of packages; BeePM is worthless as a package manager. Throughout the coming years, however,
the BeePM project is sure to have plenty of packages.
